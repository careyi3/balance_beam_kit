# CAD

Supplied here are the `.stl` files needed to print your own versions of the required parts.

Also included here is my g-code for printing the parts on my Ender3 V2. These g-code files are included for my reference to keep track of my own work, these more than likely won't work for you, do not use them, please slice your own.
