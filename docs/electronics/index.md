## Introduction

In this section we are going to break down our discussion into four main topics for discussion. stepper motors and drivers, the Arduino microcontroller, the acoustic position sensor and finally the PCB. The most advanced topic of the discussion is the PCB and in this section we will also discuss the details of the design of the power switching circuit on the board.

In a final part to this section, we will also provide a basic circuit diagram for getting the board working on a breadboard or protoboard.
