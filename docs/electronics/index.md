In this section we are going to break down our discussion into four main topics for discussion. stepper motors and drivers, the Arduino microcontroller, the acoustic position sensor and finally the PCB. The most advanced topic of the discussion is the PCB and in this section we will also discuss the details of the design of the power switching circuit on the board.

In a final part to this section, we will also provide a basic circuit diagram for getting the board working on a breadboard or protoboard.

## Arduino

An Arduino is a low cost, flexible, simple and robust microcontroller. In the wild, microcontrollers are the smart electronics that control electronic devices. Microcontrollers are tiny programmable computers that exist on a single chip. In terms of electronics, they occupy the space somewhere between things that are simple on-off devices with analog components and fully fledged computers. That is to say, a microcontroller can typically interface with simple low level electronics but can bring some intelligence to them while not having the power of a full computer. Even tho these devices don't have the computing power of full computers, modern microcontroller are incredibly powerful and capable of doing amazing things. Microcontroller shine in their ability to do relatively complex tasks at a low level very fast while consuming very little power. Consider that a modern computer has to be able to do lots of different things all at once, typically a microcontroller only has to do one or a small hand full of things at a time; in this way, they can be highly optimised for the task at hand.

While there are loads of different kind of microcontroller available these days, Arduino's provide a great platform to learn embedded software development and electronics. Arduino's are cheap and very robust, they are hard to blow up compared to other kinds of microcontroller, and when they are blown up, they are easily replaceable. Arduino's also come with a companion software development environment and a whole host of nice libraries and hardware abstractions which means you can get up and running really quickly. There is also a huge online community ready and willing to provide support.

For all of the above reasons and more, I choose to base the kit around an Arduino. I also have a lot of experience personally working with these devices so it was quick for me to prototype the system using one.

To learn more about Arduino I suggest visiting their [website](https://www.arduino.cc/) where you can find loads of information on them. Aside from the basic background presented here, we will dive into more detail about working with an Arduino in the [programming](../programming) section of this guide.

For this project, we will use an Arduino Nano. You can use any Arduino for this, but if you wish to use the PCB for the project, it has a socket which will accept an Arduino Nano. Also note, if you are sourcing an Arduino for the first time, you can buy them from the Arduino website, however these days you can buy many many clones of them online. They are all largely the same, some might have slight differences. Largely these are fine to use but buy them at your own risk as some can be faulty. With that said, they are usually available at a fraction of the price of the branded versions.
