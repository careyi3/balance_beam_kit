The main goal of the project is to act as a resource for teaching the basics of control theory and in particular the practical implementation of a PID controller. Below is a system diagram showing the main components of the system and their connection in the common system diagram format.

Before we dive into the details, there are two videos of mine which will help, this first one is dedicated to explaining the [software behind the system in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBsXWNbOTRY) and the next one is an in depth look at [implementing your own PID controller from scratch on an Arduino](https://youtu.be/RZW1PsfgVEI) (you may want to wait until after you have read this to watch, or not, who knows!).
