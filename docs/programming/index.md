## Introduction

In this section we will provide a basic overview of getting started with programming an Arduino microcontroller. We will then jump into some more complex discussion of how some of the important parts of the code work under the hood.

## The Basics

## AccelStepper Library

## Coding a PID Controller

## HC-SR04 Library

## Kalman Filter
