# Code

Included here is test and sample code for the rig. Under `ball_and_beam` you will find the main Arduino sketch implementing a simple PID loop to stabilise the ball along the midpoint of the beam.

Along side the main code under `tests`, you will find simple test code for interfacing with the stepper via the driver and for interfacing with the acoustic position sensor.
